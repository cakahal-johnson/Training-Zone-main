                    local residents, mostly between the ages of 18 and 45, as this group forms the majority of our current 
                    audience (mature age job seekers), and this is who the site is aimed at. The website should produce an 
                    increase of local customers of at least 40%. We think more people would train with us if they knew 
                    about us more.</p>

                <p class="para_details"> Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it:    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>• Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work. </li>

                        <li>• Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not 
                            enough). </li>
                            <li>• Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's 
                                not on the web. </li>
                                <li> Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>o If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 
                                            that's 33%. </li>
                                            <li>o Which one are you most on top of? </li>
                                            <li>o Which subject has the most complete lecture notes?</li>

                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>• Don't ask your lecturer - "did I miss anything in the lecture?" If you didn't miss anything, there'd 
                                    be no point to lectures</li>
                    </ol>
